# Task Scheduling using Critical Path Method

This project aims to implement Task Scheduling using the Critical Path Method (CPM). The Critical Path Method is a project management technique used to determine the longest sequence of dependent tasks and ensure efficient scheduling to complete a project as soon as possible.

## Features

- Calculation of earliest start time (ES), earliest finish time (EF), latest start time (LS), latest finish time (LF) for each task.
- Support for dependency types (SS,SF,FF,FS) and dependency lag.
- Identification of critical path(s) in the project.
- Visualization of the project schedule.
- Algorithm is done using PHP

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshayna7/Task-Scheduling-using-Critical-Path-Method.git
